### Do this Before Ses #2

Find a thesis advisor; read his/her published work; let your thesis advisor know the timeline for your proposal work.

Fill out a thesis intent form and turn it in to the mechanical engineering undergraduate office. (If you have not done so already.)

Get a thesis notebook.

Scope the 2.ThA archives for similar projects; surf the web for similar masters/PhD proposals; use these sources to determine what sorts of background information you will need for your thesis; jot down these information requirements in a format that is legible to others. (In your notebook would be fine.)

Fill out the "MadLib" thesis proposal outline.

Complete the research assignment; see handout.
